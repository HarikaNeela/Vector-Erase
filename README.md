# Vector-Erase
The following are some useful vector functions:                              erase(int position):     Removes the element present at position.   Ex: v.erase(v.begin()+4); (erases the fifth element of the vector v)                              erase(int start,int end):  Removes the elements in the range from start to end inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end.                     Ex:v.erase(v.begin()+2,v.begin()+5);(erases all the elements from the third element to the fifth element.)
